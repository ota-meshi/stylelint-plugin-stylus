## :book: Rule Details

This rule require or disallow a leading zero for fractional numbers less than 1.

## :question: Why Not Use `stylelint` Rule

The [number-leading-zero] rule incorrectly report errors in Stylus.  
This problem is that the core rules do not understand that range operator of the Stylus.  
The `stylus/number-leading-zero` rule understands that range operator of the Stylus.

## :wrench: Options

See [stylelint - number-leading-zero - Options](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules/number-leading-zero#options).
